 * author- Omoze Oyarebu
 * Project-Write a program that computes a studentâ€™s grade in a course. The course grade
 *         has three components: homework assignments, a midterm exam, and a final exam.
 *         The program should prompt the user for all information necessary to compute the
 *         grade, such as the number of homework assignments, the points earned and points
 *         possible for each assignment, the midterm and final exam scores.
 * Version 1.0
 *
 * Limitations-Unstructured approach.
